# MAZE-v1
A prototype of my little maze game. If you can beat it I will put you in the game.
Work-in-progress


## Known Issues
- writing on and dropping hundreds of pages from the journal can cause high RAM usage and potentially cause a crash
- fullscreen toggle is not working
- there is currently no way to save your progress
- there is currently no way to rebind controls or change in-game camera sensitivity
- the maze is notoriously difficult to beat
